# FiniteVolumeGodunovKA — the `@fvkernel` contract

**Goal.** Write a finite-volume Godunov solver's *physics* once, in pure Julia, and run it
fast on **CPU and CUDA** (Metal a desirable bonus) — covering the full solver suite we
benchmarked: hydro / GLM-MHD / CT × PLM/PPM × ±species, with HLL/HLLC/HLLD/LLF. The library
exists because CUDA.jl/KA codegen tops out at ~60–67% of hand-written `.cu` for these kernels
(see `../JULIA_NATIVE_PERF.md`); the performance backends route *around* that wall (SIMD on
CPU, transpile-to-native on GPU) while the user authors only Julia.

This is the KernelAbstractions *philosophy* (write-once, multi-backend) specialized to FV
Godunov, with the performant backends KA lacks for this domain. The name keeps the KA signal;
the README must be explicit that it's the performant counterpart, not a thin KA wrapper.

## The split: 5 pure functions from the user, all structure from the library

A **system** is a `<: FVSystem` value; the per-cell physics are methods on the contract's
generic functions, written over a generic element type `T` and **branch-free on field values**
(`ifelse`/`min`/`max`, never `if x>0`). That single rule is what lets the identical source run
as `Float32` scalars on a CUDA thread *and* `Vec{W,Float32}` lanes on a CPU core.

```julia
@fvsystem Euler begin
    nvars = 5
    vidx  = (2, 3, 4)                 # momentum components — ROTATE under dim permutation
    @params γ = 5f0/3f0

    cons2prim(U, p)  = ...            # required: conserved → primitive
    prim2cons(W, p)  = ...            # required: primitive → conserved
    physflux_x(W, p) = ...            # required: x-direction physical flux ONLY
    maxspeed_x(W, p) = ...            # required: |u_x| + c   (CFL + LLF)
    eig_x(W, p)      = ...            # optional: (u_x, c)    (HLL/HLLC)
end
```

The last arg `p` is the params placeholder; `@fvsystem` desugars to `struct Euler <: FVSystem`
+ `@inline` methods on the contract functions (Trixi-style: idiomatic, dispatch-extensible).
GLM-MHD is the *same shape* — `@conserved`-equivalent tuple gains `B[3], ψ`, `@params` gains
`ch`, plus a ψ-damping source; no new concepts. That hydro and GLM share this contract is the
test that it's the right 80%.

### Two design wins that keep it small

1. **Rotation is the library's job.** The user writes *only* `physflux_x`. Because `vidx`
   marks the rotating vector components, the y/z sweeps permute those into the x-slot, call the
   same `physflux_x`, and permute back — one flux function, three directions, exactly as the
   `.cu` marches do.
2. **Riemann is layered.** From `physflux_x`+`maxspeed_x` the library assembles **LLF** for any
   system; with `eig_x` it adds **HLL**. **HLLC (Euler)** and **HLLD (MHD)** ship as built-ins
   keyed to the system, since they need the wave structure. `riemann=HLLC()` is a launch knob,
   never user-reimplemented.

## What the user never writes (library services)

Reconstruction (PLM/PPM + MonCen limiter), the staged shared-memory **cube** and the **march**,
the f16-tile+f32-update rule, the conservative update, halos/boundaries, the occupancy-cliff
auto-tuner (per device), and backend dispatch. `@fvkernel` is the compiler entry that fuses
*system + recon + riemann + backend* into the tiled kernel; `step!`/`evolve!` are the same call
on every backend.

## Three locked design decisions

1. **State = `NTuple{N,T}` under the hood**, named destructuring at the macro surface. Keeps the
   fast path tuple-simple (trivially SIMD-able) and the user code readable.
2. **`physflux_x` + `maxspeed_x` are the required primitive** (→ LLF/HLL for free); HLLC/HLLD are
   built-in opt-ins keyed to the system. A user may still supply a hand-written `riemann` method.
3. **CT seam reserved, not built.** v0 `@fvsystem` is cell-centered only, but the grammar
   reserves `@staggered B[3]` + an `@emf` flux→edge-EMF→curl hook so CT slots in without
   reshaping the contract. Reserve now; implement after CPU+CUDA cell-centered is solid.

## Status

Implemented and **passing** (`test/runtests.jl`):
- `@fvsystem` contract + the `Euler` system defined entirely through it.
- Library PLM (MC limiter for shocks, `:none` unlimited for smooth) + LLF/HLL/HLLC.
- A reference **CPU scalar 1D** backend (`Grid1D`, MUSCL-Hancock, periodic/outflow BCs).
- A **SIMD CPU 1D** backend (`Grid1DSoA`): SoA state, vectorized along the grid with shifted
  vector loads, `T = Vec{8,Float32}` lanes + a scalar tail — reusing the per-cell physics verbatim.
- A **CUDA 1D** backend (`Grid1DCU`): one GPU thread per cell, fused per-cell recompute, `T =
  Float32`, in-kernel BC (mod1/clamp), double-buffered device state — the same physics verbatim.
- A **2D CPU** backend (`Grid2D`): Strang dimensional splitting (x·y·x), where the y-sweep reuses the
  per-cell physics through `_update_dir` + the rotation perm — **the user wrote only `physflux_x`**.
- **GLM-MHD** (`GLMMHD`) defined through the *same* contract: 9 vars, two rotating vectors (momentum
  AND B via `vidx = ((2,3,4),(6,7,8))`), the Dedner flux, `ch` param, and a `source` (ψ-damping) — runs
  on every backend.
- A **2D CUDA** backend (`Grid2DCU`): one thread per cell, the same Strang sweeps + source, reusing
  `_update_dir` + the perm. Bit-identical to the 2D CPU backend; runs Orszag-Tang on the GPU.
- An optional **`@source`** contract hook (operator-split), applied after each step; default identity.
- **Sod shock tube (Float32, HLLC):** post-shock ρ=0.2655 / P=0.3031 vs exact 0.2656 / 0.3031;
  positivity + mass conservation hold.
- **Entropy-wave convergence (Float64):** L1 order 2.34 → 2.15 → 2.05 → **2.01** (nx 16→256).
  Run in Float64 from the *same* Float32-authored physics — the element-type genericity that every
  backend depends on, demonstrated end-to-end.
- **One source, three backends, all bit-identical.** SIMD ≡ scalar AND CUDA ≡ scalar — max |Δ| = 0
  on Sod and the smooth wave, across HLLC/HLL/LLF (SIMD also on a non-multiple-of-8 grid, exercising
  the tail). The element-generic physics is provably the same code on a CPU thread, a SIMD lane, and
  a GPU thread. Throughput (A6000): **CPU scalar ~9–14, CPU SIMD ~60 (4.7×–6.8×, single core), CUDA
  ~11,400 Mcell/s** (≥1M cells; ~190× the single-core SIMD).
- **Rotation is exact (the design-defining result).** A single y-sweep — the y-flux obtained purely by
  swapping the marked vector components and calling the same `physflux_x` — is **bit-identical**
  (max |Δ| = 0) to the x-sweep on the transposed problem, for **both Euler (1 vector) and GLM-MHD
  (2 vectors, momentum + B swapped together)**. The 2D Strang scheme is 2nd order (diagonal entropy
  wave, order 2.22 → 2.09). The user writes one flux function; the library does y and z.
- **The contract scales to MHD.** Going Euler → GLM-MHD was: add 4 variables, add the `ch` param, write
  `physflux_x`, and declare `vidx` as *two* triples. The rotation machinery (a compile-time permutation
  over all triples) handled the rest. Brio-Wu shock tube: stable, positive, mass-conserving, and the
  normal field Bx is preserved to **max |Bx − 0.75| = 0** — exactly.

## Documented negative — device-resident "lagged" dt (don't re-attempt naively)

Hypothesis: the per-step `dt` (a wavespeed reduction read back to the host) serializes the GPU, so
fold the wavespeed into the sweep (free — it already evaluates `maxspeed_x`) to set the *next* step's
`dt`, keep `dt`/`t` on the device, and sync only every K steps. Built it, validated it **correct**
(agrees with `:exact` to max |Δρ| ≈ 5e-4, identical div·B), and measured: it ran **~8× slower** (256²
OT t=0.5: 0.06 s exact vs 0.53 s lagged). Two lessons:

1. **The per-step host sync was never the bottleneck.** `:exact` runs 256² OT in **0.06 s** (~85 µs/step
   incl. the speed kernel + `maximum` reduction + sync). An earlier "2.6 s" figure was *compilation*,
   not runtime — always warm up before timing.
2. **Don't replace a parallel reduction with a single-address atomic.** Folding the wavespeed in via
   `CUDA.@atomic amax[1] = max(...)` makes all 65536 cells atomic-max into *one* scalar → fully
   serialized (~700 steps × 65536 atomics ≈ the 0.5 s observed). `maximum(spd)` is a proper
   hierarchical reduction and wins decisively.

If profiling ever shows the dt sync mattering at scale, revisit with a *block-hierarchical* reduction
(one atomic per block), never per-cell atomics. For now `:exact` is the right design.

## Roadmap (priority order)

1. ~~**SIMD-CPU backend**~~ ✅ done (single-core, ~5–7× over scalar, bit-identical). Next CPU
   increments: **threads + cache-blocking** (toward the `cpu_simd.jl` ~120 Mcell/s with NUMA), and
   `Vec{16}` on AVX-512 hosts.
2. ~~**CUDA backend**~~ ✅ done (1D, fused per-cell, bit-identical to CPU, ~11,400 Mcell/s). Open
   items: the staged shared-memory **cube** in multi-D; whether CUDA.jl plateaus below the `.cu`
   here (it didn't for this register-light fused 1D kernel) → the transpile-to-CUDA-C escape hatch
   only where needed; move CUDA to a **weakdep + package extension** so CPU-only installs stay light.
3. ~~**Multi-D + rotation**~~ ✅ 2D CPU (`Grid2D`) via Strang splitting; rotation bit-exact, 2nd order.
4. ~~**GLM-MHD via the contract**~~ ✅ 9 vars, two-vector rotation, Brio-Wu validated, ψ-damping
   `source` hook, **2D CUDA** backend (`Grid2DCU`, bit-identical to CPU), Orszag-Tang on GPU (256² to
   t=0.5 in **0.06 s** post-warmup; 512² in 0.34 s; stable, controlled div·B), and **dynamic `ch`** =
   global max fast speed each step (the `fastspeed_x` + `prestep` contract hooks; OT div·B 2.34 → 2.06),
   and an **HLLD** built-in (Miyoshi-Kusano, keyed to `GLMMHD`): branch-free, stable, positive,
   conservative, Bx-exact, rotation bit-exact. Open MHD items: CT for exact div·B.
   - *HLLD debugging notes (for future MHD solvers):* the L=R→physflux consistency check + bit-exact
     rotation isotropy localize bugs fast. Two real ones found: the transverse star formula is valid
     only when `dK = ρ(S−u)(S−Sₘ) − Bₓ² > 0` (else fall back to the un-rotated limit, not `1/dK`); and
     the star **energy** convective term is `(S−u)·E` (E is a density), NOT `(S−u)·ρ·E` — the spurious
     `ρ` blew up the low-density state. Guard `sqrt(ρ*)` (computed branch-free, even where unselected).
5. ~~**2D SIMD** backend~~ ✅ `Grid2DSoA`: SoA flat storage (x contiguous), vectorized along x for
   both sweeps (x-sweep shifted x-loads; y-sweep aligned x-blocks at rows j±1/j±2), reusing
   `_update_dir` + perm with `Vec{8}`. Bit-identical to scalar 2D (Euler/HLLC + GLM/HLLD), ~6.6× faster
   single-core.
6. ~~**3D**~~ ✅ `Grid3D` (scalar), **`Grid3DSoA` (SIMD)**, **`Grid3DCU` (CUDA)`**: symmetric Strang
   x·y·z·y·x; the z-sweep uses `dirperm(s,N,3)` — the rotation machinery generalized to all 3 axes with
   **no new code**. z-rotation isotropy bit-exact, 3D convergence 2nd order (2.19/2.14); SIMD & CUDA
   bit-identical to scalar (Euler/HLLC + GLM/HLLD). Throughput @128³: scalar 0.9, SIMD 6.7, CUDA 1703.
   Remaining: `Vec{16}` on AVX-512; **CT**; **Metal**.
7. ~~**CPU threads**~~ ✅ chunk-capped `Threads.@threads` over rows (2D) / z-planes (3D) in the SIMD
   backends; bit-identical at any thread count. **Peak ~145 Mcell/s at 16 threads** (12× over
   single-thread, beats the `cpu_simd.jl` 120 target). KEY FINDING: these kernels are
   **memory-bandwidth-bound**, so they peak at ~8–16 threads and **over-subscription hurts** (64→71,
   128→collapses on small grids). The chunk-cap (`≥ _MINROWS` lines/task) prevents the worst
   small-grid footgun, but the right knob is `JULIA_NUM_THREADS ≈ 8–16` — do NOT use `-t auto` (128)
   for these. **Cache-blocking** (sweep-fusion over tiles) is a further refinement, not yet needed
   since threading already exceeds the target; deferred.
6. **Metal** — measure the Metal.jl gap vs its bandwidth roofline before deciding native-vs-MSL.
7. **CT** through the reserved staggered/EMF seam (exact div·B, vs GLM's cleaning).
8. **Packaging:** move CUDA to a weakdep + extension (CPU-only installs stay light).

Conformance lives in the parent `GLMMHDTurb` repo (OT, Sod, turbulence, div·B, the gradient-IC
benchmarks): the spec is "reproduce that matrix from one physics source on every backend."
